# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below:

A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

In this repo, we will create a linked list and simple helper functions. 
Linked list is a piece of dynamically allocated memory, hence it needs to be freed like creating a dynamically allocated array.

Additionally, we will find the length of a linked list using two different methods:

1. Using a loop
2. Recursively

Finally, the last task is to find if some element "x" is present in a linked list. This will be accomplished using both the options above as well.
